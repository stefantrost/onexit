# onexit

Javascript drop-in, that opens a pop-up, when the user moves the cursor out of the document up into the menu bar of the 
browser. The pop-up will be shown once per page visit.

Set path to directory in onexit.config.json.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Put your popup content in onexit.html.

Customize the styling directly in onexit.css or override in your stylesheet.

Done. Enjoy!
=======
Right now onexit depends on JQuery (\>= 2.x.x). I'll remove the dependency asap.
